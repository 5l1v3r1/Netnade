The Netnade
==================
This is a small network "hand grenade", used to preform DHCP exhaustion attacks.  Flash an Arduino with this code and plug it into an ethernet network and watch as it endlessly generates random MAC addresses and acquires DHCP leases with them. 

Requirements
==================
* Arduino
* Ethernet Shield
